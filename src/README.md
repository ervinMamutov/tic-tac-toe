# Source (`src`) Folder

Welcome to the `src` folder! This is the heart of our project, containing all the main codebase components. Everything from the components functions to utility functions, event handlers, listeners, and the main entry file of the project are organized here.

## Structure

Below you'll find a detailed breakdown of the key directories and files within this folder:

### Components Folder

This folder includes all the individual components that make up different parts of the application. Think of these as the building blocks of the user interface.

### Utils Folder

Utility functions that carry out common tasks and logic throughout the application reside here. These might include functions for formatting data, or any other shared logic.

### Handlers Folder

This is where you'll find all of the specific handlers for various events and actions within the application. This can include response handlers, error handlers, and more.

### Events Folder

This folder contains all the listeners that are set up to respond to various user interactions and other events. Whether it's a click, mouseover, or custom event, listeners are organized here.

### `init.js`

The entry point of the project. This file initializes the application, sets up the initial state, and kicks everything off. It ties everything together.

### `dom.js`

This file includes all the references and manipulations related to the DOM elements in the project. It's like a central hub for anything that interacts with the page's structure and layout.

### `data.js`

All static and dynamic data related to the project are managed within this file. It can include your data.
