## Game Overview

### Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The aim is to place three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### Game Conditions

- 3x3 grid.
- Players use 'X' or 'O' marks.
- Three marks in a line to win.
- A draw if all squares are filled without a win.
- Option to restart the game.

## Development Approach

### Importance of Vanilla JavaScript

Using plain JavaScript, without third-party libraries:

- Enhances core JavaScript understanding.
- Provides code control.
- Minimizes dependencies.
- Facilitates a fast-loading application.

### Separation of Concerns

Ensuring code modularity:

- **Components**: Isolated UI elements.
- **Logic**: Specific functions for rules and behavior.
- **Styles**: Separate visual styling.
- **Data Management**: Separate game state and player information handling.

## Testing

Ensuring code reliability:

### Components Testing

- Correct rendering.
- Proper user interaction handling.

### Utility Functions Testing

- Expected output for given inputs.
- Handling edge cases and unexpected inputs.
- Proper interaction with other system parts.

## Setup and Running

### Set up

```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test -- path-to-your-test
```

### Running Format

```bash
npm run format

```
