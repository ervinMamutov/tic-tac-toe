# Styles Folder

Welcome to the `styles` folder! This is where all the visual magic happens for our project. This folder contains all the CSS files and related styling assets that define the look and feel of the application.

## Structure

Here's an overview of what you can find in this folder:

### `style.css`

The main stylesheet for the project. It includes global styles, variables, and may also import other CSS files for organized and modular styling.

### Other CSS Files

Depending on the complexity of the project, you might find additional CSS files, each serving a specific purpose or related to specific components or pages.

### Pre-processors (Optional)

If the project uses CSS pre-processors like SASS or LESS, you may find additional folders and files here, structured to maintain an efficient and scalable styling environment.

## Guidelines

- **Modularity**: Try to keep styles modular and organized. Use comments to separate sections, and consider splitting extensive styles into multiple files if needed.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to a consistent naming convention and styling practice across all files.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the styles cater to various device sizes and orientations.
- **Optimization**: Minimize the use of redundant or unnecessary styles, and consider optimizing the final CSS for production.
